Talis aims to transform diagnostic testing by developing and commercializing innovative products that are designed to enable accurate, reliable, low cost and rapid molecular testing for infectious diseases and other conditions at the point-of-care.

Point-of-care testing solves this problem by delivering the timely information necessary for clinical care.
We are developing the Talis One platform, a sample-to-answer, cloud-enabled molecular diagnostic platform that, once authorized, could be rapidly deployed to distributed diagnostic settings in the United States and around the world to diagnose infectious disease at the point-of-care.

Data Scientist,$73K - $143K (Glassdoor est.),"At Density, we build one of the most advanced people sensing systems in the world. The product and infrastructure is nuanced and one-of-a-kind. Building this product for scale has been an exercise in patience, creativity, remarkable engineering, laser physics, global logistics, and grit. The team is thoughtful, driven, and world-class.
We build systems that are real-time, accurate, and anonymous by design. Our systems help today’s largest companies understand how their buildings get used. We have counted hundreds of millions of people.
Counting people in “real-time” is unique and particularly hard to achieve. It allows a user to walk into a room, beneath our sensor, and see the room’s occupancy increment 700ms later.
Today alone, Density will ingest over 1m events. In the coming year, our sensor network is on track to grow ten-fold. The overall system load is exploding. Maintaining our low latency standards requires an increasingly thoughtful system.
We’re architecting infrastructure where annual, unscheduled downtime is measured in minutes. We’re building intelligent redundancies so missed events are an oddity. We’re constructing an exceptional engineering team to support always-on, intelligible analytics generated on the fly.
This role reports to our Director of Data Science & Engineering.
As a at Density, you will work on algorithms developed for applications deployed on state-of-the-art remote devices as well as our cloud platform. The data you will work with includes ToF depth data, point clouds from radar, and device parameters.

Xenon gas exhibits solubility and signal properties that enable it to be imaged within other tissues and organs.
The Challenge and Opportunity
Polarean's technology provides a unique and sensitive way to monitor changes in lung structure and function; it is currently used in basic and clinical research to study lung physiology and to monitor the efficacy of new drugs. After the successful completion of two Phase III pivotal trials showing equivalence to the FDA-approved standard of 133Xe Scintigraphy, followed by a positive pre-NDA meeting, Polarean submitted an NDA (new drug application) to the FDA in October 2020. The first approval in the US for this drug/device combination diagnostic is anticipated for Q3 2021. The initial target indication is for the evaluation of pulmonary function and imaging of the lungs using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
